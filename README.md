***Main goal of the project is to increase av.check from future purchases having in hand all the association rules***.

***This could be used either through a pop-up for instance in your website once the client choose a particular item or a message to the sales team while using the ERP to push different items based on the consumer behavior***.

***Algorithm based on 3 paremeters such as support(How many times bread(x) and butter(y) appears together out of all the transactions(n)), confidence(Out of 10 transactions that we have this combo bread(x) and butter(y) how many times we have bread(x)) and lift that basically says the impact of the bread to boost butter sales here once this ratio is greater than 1 becomes interesting to work on this rule***.
